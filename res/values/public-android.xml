   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ANYONE MODIFYING THIS FILE
   READ THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES

   This file defines the binary compatibility for resources.  As such,
   you must be very careful when making changes here, or you will
   completely break backwards compatibility with old applications.

   To avoid breaking compatibility, all new resources must be placed
   at the end of the list of resources of the same type.  Placing a resource
   in the middle of type will cause all following resources to be
   assigned new resource numbers, breaking compatibility.
